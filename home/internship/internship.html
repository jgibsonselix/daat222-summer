<p>In the spring, I was selected to participate in Studio Institute's Arts
  Intern program, for those interested in working in the museum sector who have
  great financial need. But when COVID-19 cases spiked in the US, there was a
  strong possibility that the internship may be cancelled. Fortunately, the
  program decided to go completely virtual.</p>
<p>I was hired by the Free Library of Philadelphia as the graphic design intern
  to develop their upcoming exhibition honoring the centennial of Suffrage and
  the 19th Amendment!</p>
